// Variables are like containers in Js
// We can assign different types of data in different types of variables.
// Basically We use let, const, var (!), to declare any variables. Note: We rarely use var !
// Here var is global scope and let is block scope.
var a = 1
const author = "Aarogya"
let b = 60
console.log(a,b,author)
{
    let a = 20
    console.log(a)
}
 
console.log(a)
